# Real World Crypto 2017

## Session 1: TLS Engineering

### Software engineering and OpenSSL is not an oxymoron
- Post-Heartbleed: more sponsors and F2F developer meetings 
- Increased focus on testing (up to 57% coverage), regular (and planned) releases, and increased transparency
- Removed dozens of outdated platforms and trimmed dead or unneeded code
- Closed old bugs and asked originators to reopen them on Github if they're still relevant
- TLS 1.3 fixed delivery date in Q1 2017

### Project Wycheproof - Scaling crypto testing
- Google depends (partly) on third party crypto libraries (OpenSSL, OpenJDK, Bouncy Castle, etc.) [?]
    - APIS (AEAD, MAC, PKE, DS) are build on these libraries
- Motivation: need common framework for testing third party libraries for known bugs 
- Wycheproof:
    - 80+ unit tests
    - Out-of-box runners for libraries
- Notable bugs discovered: key recovery in OpenJDK's DSA and Bouncy Castle's ECDHC
- Common crypto interfaces for C++, Python, Go, Javascript, Java, etc. are *desperately needed*
- Sensible interfaces are also needed:
    - Allow effortless switching algorithms adhering to the same interface
    - Show crypto properties in the code [?]
    - Never ask user to provide critical input

### X.509 in Practice (It's worse than you think)
- TLS phishing is on the rise, but still rather small (in the 100s per day [?])
- Certificate sharing (across banks) is still prevalent -- what happens when keys need to change (see Heartbleed)?
    - Some banks just had their certificates, with the same key, re-signed
- Poor certificate algorithms (MD5 and SHA1), keys (RSA 1024 bits), versions (< V3), etc. are still problematic
- Downgrading happened without switching of certificate providers -- so why did the downgrades occur in reaction to Heartbleed et al?

##Session 2: Crypto for Internet Protocols

### NSEC5: Provably Preventing DNSSEC Zone Enumeration
- Offline zone enumeration requires online crypto
- NSEC: sign the gaps
- NSEC3: hash domains and sign the gaps *offline*
- NSEC3-WL: hash domains, sign the gaps *online*
- NSEC5 = NSEC3-WL with a VRF instead of standard H (hash function)
    - A VRF is a publicly keyed hash function -- compute with a secret key and verify with a public key
    - VRF proofs must be provided with the NSEC5 records
- Replay attacks are not possible since the signature and VRF proof are computed based on the query (must include a nonce?)
- Preventing replays of pre-NSEC5 records is not possible beyond standard TTL and NSEC record lifetime enforcement

### Cryptographically Securing the Network Time Protocol
- Relevant references:

    - https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_dowling.pdf

    - https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime
    - https://github.com/dfoxfranke/nts
- (NTP overview)
- Symmetric authenticaton (for NTP) uses prefix-key MD5 (MD5(K || M)) -- length extension attacks not really a concern 
- NTP servers have an exceptionally large number of clients
    - Stateless query processing is a must
- NTS approach: use (D)TLS to create a session, export keys, and use them to AEAD-encrypt request and response
- Some properties of TLS are problematic from a privacy perspective (tickets, e.g.), but that will be addressed with TLS 1.3
