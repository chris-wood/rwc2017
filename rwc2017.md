# Real World Crypto 2017

## Session 1: TLS Engineering

### Software engineering and OpenSSL is not an oxymoron
- Post-Heartbleed: more sponsors and F2F developer meetings 
- Increased focus on testing (up to 57% coverage), regular (and planned) releases, and increased transparency
- Removed dozens of outdated platforms and trimmed dead or unneeded code
- Closed old bugs and asked originators to reopen them on Github if they're still relevant
- TLS 1.3 fixed delivery date in Q1 2017

### Project Wycheproof - Scaling crypto testing
- Google depends (partly) on third party crypto libraries (OpenSSL, OpenJDK, Bouncy Castle, etc.) [?]
    - APIS (AEAD, MAC, PKE, DS) are build on these libraries
- Motivation: need common framework for testing third party libraries for known bugs 
- Wycheproof:
    - 80+ unit tests
    - Out-of-box runners for libraries
- Notable bugs discovered: key recovery in OpenJDK's DSA and Bouncy Castle's ECDHC
- Common crypto interfaces for C++, Python, Go, Javascript, Java, etc. are *desperately needed*
- Sensible interfaces are also needed:
    - Allow effortless switching algorithms adhering to the same interface
    - Show crypto properties in the code [?]
    - Never ask user to provide critical input

### X.509 in Practice (It's worse than you think)
- TLS phishing is on the rise, but still rather small (in the 100s per day [?])
- Certificate sharing (across banks) is still prevalent -- what happens when keys need to change (see Heartbleed)?
    - Some banks just had their certificates, with the same key, re-signed
- Poor certificate algorithms (MD5 and SHA1), keys (RSA 1024 bits), versions (< V3), etc. are still problematic
- Downgrading happened without switching of certificate providers -- so why did the downgrades occur in reaction to Heartbleed et al?

### Is Crypto Software Safe Yet?
(Review of some attacks in go-jose and Bouncy Castle)

##Session 2: Crypto for Internet Protocols

### NSEC5: Provably Preventing DNSSEC Zone Enumerationasd
- Relevant links:
    - http://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/papers/nsec5.pdf
    - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924218
- Offline zone enumeration requires online crypto
- NSEC: sign the gaps
- NSEC3: hash domains and sign the gaps *offline*
- NSEC3-WL: hash domains, sign the gaps *online*
- NSEC5 = NSEC3-WL with a VRF instead of standard H (hash function)
    - A VRF is a publicly keyed hash function -- compute with a secret key and verify with a public key
    - VRF proofs must be provided with the NSEC5 records
- Replay attacks are not possible since the signature and VRF proof are computed based on the query (must include a nonce?)
- Preventing replays of pre-NSEC5 records is not possible beyond standard TTL and NSEC record lifetime enforcement

### Cryptographically Securing the Network Time Protocol
- Relevant references: 
    - https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ntp-network-time-security-15
    - https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_dowling.pdf
    - https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dfranke-ntp-data-minimization-01
    - https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime
    - https://github.com/dfoxfranke/nts
- (NTP overview)
- Symmetric authenticaton (for NTP) uses prefix-key MD5 (MD5(K || M)) -- length extension attacks not really a concern 
- NTP servers have an exceptionally large number of clients
    - Stateless query processing is a must
- NTS approach: use (D)TLS to create a session, export keys, and use them to AEAD-encrypt request and response
- Some properties of TLS are problematic from a privacy perspective (tickets, e.g.), but that will be addressed with TLS 1.3

##Session 3: Quantum and Post-Quantum

### The physics of building a quantum computer
TODO

### NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography Project
- Relevant links:
    - http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/
- Full transition to PQC may take > 10 years
- Current outlook:
    - Speed looks good
    - Key sizes may increases (significantly)
    - Signature sizes can be large
    - Possible increase in ciphertext sizes
    - *industry impact assessment must be done now*

### Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices — CRYSTAL
(none)

##Session 4: Post-Quantum Crypto

### Practical post-quantum key exchange from both ideal and generic lattices
- Relevant papers and links:
    - NTRU, Regev '05 (LWE assumption), etc. [see the slides]
    - https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/659.pdf
    - https://openquantumsafe.org/
    - https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1017.pdf
    - https://github.com/lwe-frodo
- PQC breaks standard KEX protocols and requires longer key and digest sizes for symmetric encryption and hashing, respectively
    - Relevant to TLS, since KEX breakage gives an attacker the ability to decrypt logged traffic
- Frodo is based on LWE security
    - *Matrices are random*
- New Hope is based on Ring-LWE
    - Ring-LWE saves computation since each row in the matrix is a cyclic shift of the one above
    - *Matrices are cyclic*
- RLWE KEX: 
    - S -> C: AX + E
    - C -> S: YA + E\*
        - shared secret is derived from the MSBs of (YAX + YE)
        - A is generated randomly (from PRG), X,E are sampled from Gaussian noise with paramter \sigma
- Matrix generation can be done at random, which is different from parameter generation for DH-like KEXs where the group structure matters (i.e., we must use safe primes)
- KEX is parametered by (coefficient) modulus q, (matrix) dimension n, and the distribution for small matrices
- Recommended parameters:
    - Frodo: q = 2^15, n = 752, table distribution => quantum security: 130 bits
    - NewHope: q = 12289, n = 1024, binominal distribution => quantum security: 255 bits
- Network complexity: 
    - Frodo: ~22 KiB 
    - NewHope: ~4 KiB
- Processing complexity:
    - Frodo: 1.4ms
    - NewHope: 0.2ms    

### Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman
- Some ECC benefits:
    - Factoring and primality proving
    - Small and fast KEX
    - Digital signatures
    - Pairings: ID-based crypto, proxy re-encryption, etc.
    - ...
- (did not easily follow the rest) 

##Session 5: Embedded Crypto

### The Strobe protocol framework
- Relevant links: 
    - https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/noise/2015/000220.html
    - https://strobe.sourceforge.io/
    - https://strobe.sourceforge.io/papers/strobe-latest.pdf
- Protocol framework with embedded focus: simple protocols and handshakes, e.g., encrypt, MAC, hash, sign, etc.
- Goals: simple and easy to analyze, non-terrible performance
- Use: when best practices (TLS and IPsec) don't work due to diverse reqiuirements:
    - public key encryption and auth. algorithms
    - different or odd message flow
    - code size and memory requirements
        - these all tend to yield custom protocols!
- Modern solution (for auth.): hash everything (input to protocol, e.g. messages sent and received)
    - TLS 1.3, Noise, BLINKER, etc.
- STROBE sits in the middle and "hashes all the things" -> goal is to make the output look like a RO
- Can use it to build FHMQV-C
- Operations: key, AD, PRF, send clear, rcv clear, send enc, recv enc, send MAC, verify MAC, rachet [see slides for flow]
- Implementation is based on duplex sponge operation
    - state is divided into a rate and capacity
    - rate is XOR'd with inputs for operations
    - capacity is kept separate (internal) as stream-cipher-like key material for the operations
- RO behavior: input is all previous operations, including the operation type and data, as well as the *intended use* of the output
- Duplex sponge gives RO behavior, but does not yield parsability. Metadata operations are used to disambiguate outputs:
    - Metadata AD/CLR/ENC before each operation
    - Can be (tag, length) of protocol framing
- Future work: implement existing protocols using Strobe
    
### FourQ based cryptography for high performance and low power applications
- Relevant links:
    - https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ladd-cfrg-4q-00
    - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/fourqlib/
- Curve25519 and Ed448-Goldilocks were selected as CFRG-approved curves
- FourQ is a newer variant that builds on improvements in the literature
- Performance: speedup ratio ranging from 2.4-2.9x compared to Curve25519 on varying platforms
- Some properties:
    - Fastest ECC addition laws which are complete on the curve
- SchnorrQ is the signature variant of FourQ
    - i.e., closely follows the EdDSA spec, but uses FourQ
- [read the paper(s) for more details]

### Security assessment of software security: A closer look at white-box cryptographic implementations
- Relevant links:

    - http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/img/eurocrypt-2016.pdf
    - http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/203.pdf
    - https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/Tracer
- Whitebox (r.e. software): adversary owns the device running the software (maybe it's the user)
    - A system secure in this model is called a "whitebox implementation"
- Goal: prevent key exfiltration from the owner or user
- Historical use case == DRM, recent trend: host card emulation (HCE) to communicate using NFC
    - Protection of the secret key is done with a white-box implementation 
- Why not use normal crypto software code?
    - Entropy attacks (scanning memory for high entropy bits)
    - S-box blanking attacks (see slides)
- Theoretical whitebox implementation is possible => one big lookup table [that includes the key] (2^{92} TB storage)
    - Networks of tables can be used to reduce the size
- Differential correlation attacks (DCA, the software analog to DPA), is the automated attack that can be used on implementations
- Software control flow trace should mask algorithm details (i.e., there should be no side channel leaks)
    - Visualizing traces can help distinguish algorithm details, e.g., 9+1 rounds for AES
    - Unrolling and other techniques to unify the implementation help
- Existing WB encodings (see slides) do adequately hide correlations
- Open question: how does WB crypto empower or protect the user (hint: it doesn't)?
